# Hono/JSX + Vite

Author: [@MathurAditya724](https://github.com/MathurAditya724)

This example shows how to use Hono's [jsx-dom](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/jsx-dom) with Vite and integrate it with the Hono API.

## Commands

Run the `vite` dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This project is configured to use `node` runtime, you can change it to your desired runtime in the `vite.config.js` file. We are using [@hono/vite-build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hono/vite-build) package for building the project and [@hono/vite-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hono/vite-dev-server) for running the dev server.
